# MDX Bot 

 **Here's a more coherent and actionable guide to setting up the MDXBot project:**

**1. Clone the repository:**

- Launch your preferred Python IDE (PyCharm is recommended).
- Navigate to the "Get from Version Control" option (or equivalent).
- Paste the GitHub repository URL: [https://github.com/sashaKorovkina/MDXBot](https://github.com/sashaKorovkina/MDXBot)
- Follow the prompts to clone the repository into your workspace.

**2. Place the JSON file:**

- Locate the `mdx-learn.json` file you have.
- Transfer it into the root folder of the cloned repository. This is the main folder named "MDXBot."

**3. Create a virtual environment:**

- Open a terminal window within your IDE.
- Execute the command to create a virtual environment named "venv":

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

**4. Activate the virtual environment:**

- **macOS:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

- **Windows:**

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

**5. Install requirements:**

- With the virtual environment activated, run the installation command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will fetch and install all necessary dependencies for the project.

**Now you're all set to explore and work with the MDXBot code!**
